      <p class="about-info">
        Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald created <strong>Cookify</strong> in 1995,
        out of their passions for food, friendship, and hard work. Competitive
        swimmers and triathletes, Pam and Connie passed their workouts by
        engaging in passionate conversations about baking, which inspired them
        to open a small bread shop in 1995, which they named Cookify.

      <p class="about-info">
        One day, they created an ultimate chocolate chip walnut cookie to give
        them energy while training for a triathlon. They decided to sell a batch
        in their bakery, and they flew off the shelves. An icon was born. The
        cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a
        destination for epicurious travelers from around the world.
